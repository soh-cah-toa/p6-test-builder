=head1 NAME

Test::Builder::Plan - manages the plan set for the test harness

Test::Builder::NoPlan - manages the pseudo-plan when one isn't set

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Test::Builder::Plan> class manages the plan used by the test harness.
It contains the number of expected tests and formats the headers and footers
used in reporting test results.

Conversely, the C<Test::Builder::NoPlan> class is used when a plan is not
explicitly set.

B<NOTE:> The C<Test::Builder::Plan> C<Test::Builder::NoPlan> classes should not
be used directly. There are only meant to be used internally.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

C<Test::Builder> was largely inspired by chromatic's work on the old
C<Test::Builder> module for Pugs.

Additionally, C<Test::Builder> is based on the Perl 5 module of the same name
also written by chromatic <chromatic@wgz.org> and Michael G. Schwern
<schwern@pobox.com>.
